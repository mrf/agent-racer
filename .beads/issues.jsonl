{"id":"agent-racer-34sz","title":"Incremental parse loses session slug — bash-progress phantoms leak through","description":"## Symptom\nPhantom subagents appear on the dashboard (bash-progress-0, etc.) even when no Task tool subagents are running. Visible in API: `curl localhost:8080/api/sessions` shows subagents with slug matching the parent session and IDs like `bash-progress-0`.\n\n## Root Cause\n`ParseSessionJSONL()` in `jsonl.go:145` builds `result.Slug` from non-progress JSONL entries (line 209). On incremental parses (offset \u003e 0), if the batch contains only progress entries, `result.Slug` stays empty. The slug filter at line 289:\n\n    if entry.Slug != \"\" \u0026\u0026 result.Slug != \"\" \u0026\u0026 entry.Slug == result.Slug { return }\n\n...short-circuits because `result.Slug == \"\"`, so `bash-progress-*` entries (which have toolUseID != parentToolUseID and carry the parent session's slug) pass through and create phantom subagents.\n\n## Evidence\n- All `bash-progress-*` entries have toolUseID != parentToolUseID but slug == parent session slug\n- API confirmed: 2 phantom subagents with slug=elegant-noodling-thunder, id=bash-progress-0\n- Reproduced live with no Task tool running\n\n## Fix Approach\nPass the session's known slug into `ParseSessionJSONL` so incremental batches can filter self-progress:\n\n1. Add `knownSlug string` param to `ParseSessionJSONL()` — seed `result.Slug` from it\n2. Add `Slug` field to `SessionHandle` in `source.go`\n3. Populate `handle.Slug` from session state in `monitor.go` (where KnownSubagentParents is populated)\n4. Pass `handle.Slug` through `ClaudeSource.Parse()` to the parser\n5. Update all `ParseSessionJSONL` call sites (tests + production)\n\nThe previously merged fix (a6b68fc) is correct and should be kept — it replaced the fundamentally broken `toolUseID == parentToolUseID` filter with slug-based detection. This bug is about making slug detection work across incremental parse boundaries.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `backend/internal/monitor/jsonl.go` — add slug param, seed result.Slug\n- `backend/internal/monitor/claude_source.go` — pass known slug\n- `backend/internal/monitor/source.go` — add Slug to SessionHandle\n- `backend/internal/monitor/monitor.go` — populate handle.Slug from state\n- `backend/internal/monitor/jsonl_test.go` — update call signatures\n- `backend/internal/monitor/subagent_test.go` — update call signatures, add incremental slug test\n\n## Verification\n1. `go test ./internal/monitor/` passes\n2. No phantom subagents in `curl localhost:8080/api/sessions` when no Task tool is active\n3.

However, the server also sends a snapshot on new connection which resets lastSeq via the 'if msg.type === snapshot' branch, so for a clean reconnect this works correctly.

The encoding is ambiguous: a path component containing a hyphen is indistinguishable from a path separator. For example, /home/my-user/project encodes to -home-my-user-project, but so would /home/my/user-project or /home-my/user/project. The fallback (return basename) is lossy. This affects session working directory resolution for Claude sessions. GeminiSource uses SHA-256 instead (also one-way). Fix: store the original path somewhere (e.g., in the JSONL file itself or a sidecar), or use a lossless encoding like base64 or URL encoding of the path.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"markferree@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-28T11:25:47.529124478-08:00","created_by":"Mark Ferree","updated_at":"2026-02-28T11:49:10.54166093-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-28T11:49:10.54166093-08:00","close_reason":"Replaced left-to-right heuristic with exhaustive recursive search"}
